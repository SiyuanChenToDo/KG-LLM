## Limitations & Future Directions

While the ACG shows great promise, there are several limitations and future directions to consider. The computational complexity and resource requirements of ACG may be a challenge. Further research is needed to optimize its implementation. Additionally, the scalability and generalizability of ACG to a larger number of tasks and other NLP applications need to be explored. Future work should also focus on enhancing the interpretability and explainability of ACG. Developing automated methods for optimal auxiliary task selection is another key area. Alternative mechanisms such as HGB, RLG, and CTAF should also be considered. They offer different advantages and can be explored in parallel to address specific challenges in MTL.

### Detailed Roadmap for Future Work

To provide a clear path forward, we outline the short-term and long-term goals below. The short-term goals are expected to be completed within the next 6-12 months, while the long-term goals are targeted for the next 1-3 years.

#### Short-Term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)
- **Experimental Setup and Datasets**:
  - Finalize the experimental setup, including the selection of specific datasets for ABSA and SMI. Evaluate the performance of ACG using established benchmarks and metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, robustness, and generalizability).
  - Conduct controlled experiments with different contextual inputs to evaluate the performance of ACG. Use cloud-based or distributed computing to manage the computational load.
- **Complete References and Citations**:
  - Compile a comprehensive list of key references and ensure all citations are accurate and complete. This will provide a solid foundation for the literature review and support the proposed mechanisms.
- **Computational Requirements and Challenges**:
  - Expand the discussion on the computational requirements and potential challenges of implementing the proposed mechanisms, particularly RLG. Develop strategies to address these challenges, such as leveraging energy-efficient hardware, optimization techniques, and modular code development.
- **Ethical Implications**:
  - Include a section on the ethical implications of using MTL and the proposed gating mechanisms, especially in terms of fairness and transparency in task selection and model performance. Ensure that the selection process for auxiliary tasks is fair and transparent, and that the models are auditable and explainable.

#### Long-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Years)
- **Scalability and Generalizability**:
  - Investigate the scalability of ACG, HGB, RLG, and CTAF to a larger number of tasks and their generalizability to other NLP applications. Extend the application of these mechanisms to tasks such as named entity recognition, text classification, and machine translation.
- **Interpretability and Explainability**:
  - Enhance the interpretability and explainability of ACG, HGB, RLG, and CTAF by integrating XAI techniques. Develop methods to visualize and understand the decision-making process, and improve the trustworthiness of the models.
- **Automated Auxiliary Task Selection**:
  - Develop automated methods for optimal auxiliary task selection to maximize the benefits of MTL. Explore meta-learning and other advanced techniques to identify the most relevant auxiliary tasks for a given primary task.
- **Sustainability and Environmental Impact**:
  - Continuously monitor and evaluate the computational efficiency of the models to identify and address any inefficiencies. Adopt sustainable practices such as using renewable energy sources and implementing carbon offset programs to mitigate the environmental impact of the computational resources.
- **Community and Collaboration**:
  - Engage with the broader NLP and AI community to share findings, collaborate on research, and contribute to open-source projects. This will help in validating the results, improving the mechanisms, and promoting the adoption of context-aware and adaptive gating mechanisms in MTL.
